# COVID-19 Challenges


## Challenge Listing

### COVID-19 Africa Spatial Data Exploration

The first project will look at differences in response to lockdown and other distancing measures by region/income. Has the incidence rate differed by the response? Did people who stayed home more have less incidence or prevalence of disease? What other factors can explain differences in disease incidence? This project will focus on South Africa. 

The second project could focus on how to combine data from multiple sources to forecast the spatial incidence of disease. Given that we would have the mobility dataset at a provider, we could use the building dataset as an estimate of the density per ward. These could be used as features to train a model which perhaps estimates the number of infections per day or looks into other objectives of this nature. Besides the modelling, this dataset could also inform on the types of neighbourhoods(type by: density, formal/informal, e.t.c.) in which most infections occur(if we have ward-level Covid19 data*)

### COVID-19 Africa ModelHub

The goal of the ModelHub is to have a standard repository of COVID-19 forecasting/projection models for  Africa. This forms an extension of the open covid19africa project. This ModelHub aims to collect, standardise, visualise COVID-19 forecast models as well as the data they create. The ModelHub is inspired and derived from the UMass-Amherst Influenza Forecasting Center of Excellence based at the Reich Lab COVID-19 Forecast Hub.
